:::info Terminology Note

**`languageId`**: refers to **file types** (like `javascript`, `python`, `markdown`), not spoken languages (like English, German or Spanish).
For historical reasons `languageId` was chosen to match VSCode's [`Language Identifiers`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/identifiers) in meaning.
