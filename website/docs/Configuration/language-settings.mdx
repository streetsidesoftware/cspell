# Language Settings

## LanguageSettings

The Language Settings allow configuration to be based upon the programming language and/or the language locale.
There are two **selector** fields: `locale` and `languageId`.

:::info Terminology Note

**`language`** enables which spoken languages to use. A value of `"en,fr"` will enable both English and French.
Specify a locale like `"en-GB"` to be more specific.

:::

:::info Terminology Note

**`languageId`** defines which programming languages to match against.
  A value of `"python,javascript"` will match against _Python_ and _JavaScript_ files. To match against ALL programming languages,
  use `"*"`.

:::

:::info Terminology Note

**`locale`** defines which spoken languages to match against. A value of `"en-GB,nl"` will match against British English or Dutch.
  A value of `"*"` will match all spoken languages.

**`languageSettings`** can be used to set or override most configuration values allowed in a `cspell.json` file.

```javascript
    "language": "es-es",
    "languageSettings": [
        {
            // VSCode languageId. i.e. typescript, java, go, cpp, javascript, markdown, latex
            // * will match against any file type.
            "languageId": "c,cpp",
            // Language locale. i.e. en-US, de-AT, or ru. * will match all locales.
            // Multiple locales can be specified like: "en, en-US" to match both English and English US.
            "locale": "*",
            // To exclude patterns, add them to "ignoreRegExpList"
            "ignoreRegExpList": [
                "/#include.*/"
            ],
            // List of dictionaries to enable by name in `dictionaryDefinitions`
            "dictionaries": ["cpp"],
            // Dictionary definitions can also be supplied here.
            // They are only used if "languageId" and "locale" match.
            "dictionaryDefinitions": []
        },
        {
            "languageId": "*",
            "locale": "es",  // Match any Spanish locale
            "caseSensitive": true // Make spell checking case sensitive for Spanish files.
        }
    ]
