# Using CSpell Configuration

_CSpell_'s behavior can be controlled through a config file.

By default it looks for any of the following files:

<ConfigFileList />

Or you can specify a path to a config file with the `--config <path>` argument on the command line.

## How Configuration Works

Configuration is applied in two phases. The first phase gathers all relevant configuration files and merges the settings. The second phase finalizes the configuration by applying **`overrides`** and **`languageSettings`** that match the file's path, `languageId`, and `locale`.

## Configuration Gathering

The spell checker gathers all the relevant configuration files and merges the settings from each file.

**Settings Gathering Order**

1. Default Configuration - the settings included in `cspell`.
1. Command line settings - the settings given on the command line.
1. Imports found in the configuration file. - any imports found in the configuration file loaded.
1. Configuration file - the settings found in the configuration file.

### Merge Rules

Most individual settings will overwrite the settings from the previous step / file. There are a few important exceptions.

#### Array Settings are Unions

Most Array like settings are joined as a union. In most cases order is preserved.

**Examples:**

- Word lists like: `words`, `flagWords`, `ignoreWords` are the union of all the settings. The order is not preserved.
- `overrides` and `languageSettings` are accumulated in the order they were loaded to be applied later.
- `patterns`, `includeRegExpList`, and `ignoreRegExpList` are collected in order so that patterns of the same name can be replaced.
- `dictionaryDefinitions` and `dictionaries` are collected in order so that dictionaries can be replaced by other dictionaries with the same name.

## Configuration Finalization

**Order**

1. **`overrides`** - the settings from the matching `filename` globs are applied.
1. **`languageSettings`** - the settings from the matching `languageId` or `locale` are applied.

## Override Configuration Field: `overrides`

See: [Overrides](./overrides.md)

The `overrides` configuration is a useful way to force configuration on a per file basis.
The `filename` field is used to set the glob selection criteria.
When the path of the file being checked matches the glob/globs specified in `filename`, the override settings will be applied.

## Language Specific Configuration Field: `languageSettings`

See: [Language Settings](./language-settings)
