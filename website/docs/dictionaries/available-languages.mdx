# File Types and Extensions

This page provides a reference for how CSpell associates file extensions with file type IDs (also called `languageId` in configuration files for historical reasons).

## Understanding File Type Ids

:::info Terminology Note
In CSpell configuration files, the field is called `languageId` for historical reasons (to match VSCode's convention). However, this refers to **file types** (like `javascript`, `python`, `markdown`), not spoken languages (like English or Spanish).

## How CSpell Determines File Types

CSpell uses file extensions and filenames to determine the file type, which then influences:
1. Which dictionaries are enabled
2. Which patterns and rules apply
3. Whether the file should be spell-checked

## Usage Examples

### Using Overrides

Force a specific file type for certain file patterns:

```yaml
overrides:
  - filename: "**/*.xyz"
    languageId: javascript  # Treat .xyz files as JavaScript
```

Or in JSON format:

```json
{
  "overrides": [
    {
      "filename": "**/*.xyz",
      "languageId": "javascript"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Using Language Settings

Apply specific settings based on file type:

```yaml
languageSettings:
  - languageId: python,javascript
    caseSensitive: true
    dictionaries:
      - python
      - node
```

Or in JSON format:

```json
{
  "languageSettings": [
    {
      "languageId": "python,javascript",
      "caseSensitive": true,
      "dictionaries": ["python", "node"]
    }
  ]
}
```
