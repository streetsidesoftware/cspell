# Legacy Code Directory

We want to limit what is checked. Only look for Known Spelling Errors.

Some errrrors are allowed. But common typos like `recieve` are not.

This is to help with onboarding CSpell into a legacy codebase.

The idea is to:

- Report known spelling issue.
- Then slow add files to detect simple or all issues.
