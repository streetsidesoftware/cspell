# `lint`

Spell-checks one or more files.

This is the default command. Thus, doing e.g. `cspell "**"` is the same thing as doing `cspell lint "**"`.

## Options

<!-- Do not copy paste options here, as it can and will become out of date. Instead, use a script in CI to automatically generate Markdown content from the source code directly. -->

You can see the available options for this command in [the source code](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell/blob/main/packages/cspell/src/commandLint.ts).
