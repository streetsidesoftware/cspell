## Features

- Spell Checks Code -- Able to spell check code by parsing it into words before checking against the dictionaries.
- Supports CamelCase, snake_case, and compoundwords naming styles.
- Self contained -- does not depend upon OS libraries like Hunspell or aspell. Nor does it depend upon online services.
- Fast -- checks 1000's of lines of code in seconds.
- Programming Language Specific Dictionaries -- Has dedicated support for:
  - JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, PHP, C#, C++, LaTex, Go, HTML, CSS, etc.
- Customizable -- supports custom dictionaries and word lists.
- Continuous Integration Support -- Can easily be added as a linter to Travis-CI.

CSpell was initially built as the spell checking service for the [spell checker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) for
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
