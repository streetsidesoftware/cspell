# `[WIP]` Named Configurations

## Background

CSpell is highly flexible with its configuration, as a result some configurations can be quite complex. CSpell allows layering configuration by importing multiple config files in addition to using conditional configuration provided by `languageSettings` and `overrides`.

The configuration used when spell checking a file is calculated by loading the relevant config files merging them at the top level configuration and then applying matching `overrides` followed by matching `languageSettings`.

Using this technique, nearly every default configuration setting can be overridden when spell checking a specific file.

Order of imports does make a difference. `overrides` are applied in order, followed by `languageSettings`. This means that multiple `overrides` can change the same configuration setting with the last one winning.

Even though it is possible to apply settings based upon conditions in `overrides` and `languageSettings`, it is not possible to conditionally _import_ configuration. An automatic workaround is enabled by dynamically searching for the nearest configuration when checking a file. It is possible to disable dynamically loading the nearest configuration by setting `noConfigSearch` to `true`. Despite this limitation, it is not desireable to allow for _conditional imports_. _Conditional imports_ would introduce a destabilizing effect on configuration calculation and optimization.

## Problem

It is not currently possible to provide groups of settings that can be defined in one configuration file and used conditionally within the same or in another configuration file.

There are times when a dictionary / plug-in might want to publish multiple configurations or provide the ability to reuse part of a configuration.

Currently configuration can be extended using the `import` setting.

## Benefits of Named Configurations

1. Ability to define re-usable configuration, reducing copy-paste and boiler-plate configs.
1. Ability to disable or redefine named configurations. This is useful for cases when an imported configuration is not desirable for a specific situation.
1. Ability to share finer grain configurations.
